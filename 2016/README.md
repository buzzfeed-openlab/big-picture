You can put current graphics, etc, here. 

# S3
We're not really using GitHub pages for static files, except on rare occassions. Instead, they belong on S3, where our libraries belong in `/assets/` and files that are unique to a project belong in `/projects/{project folder}`:

    /assets/js/{library-name}-{version}.{extension}
    /assets/css/{library-name}-{version}.{extension} 
    /projects/YYYY-MM-{unique-name}/{anything unique to your project}

You can ask me (Amanda) if you want a complete list of current CSS and JS assets that are already in place.
